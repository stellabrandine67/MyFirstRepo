# Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Nambajimana Stella Brandine, a recent graduate of Ecole des Sciences Byimana with a strong passion for health sciences, environmental awareness, and leadership. I am currently engaged in the ALX learning pathway where I am building skills in problem-solving and digital literacy.

I aim to further my education in the health sciences field, contribute to innovative healthcare solutions, and help bridge gaps in community health systems. I am driven by a desire to create meaningful impact through research, collaboration, and a deep sense of responsibility for the world around me.
